# Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Analysis
<pre lang="markdown"> # 🔋 Electric Vehicle Charging Analysis This project explores patterns in electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior to uncover insights that can inform infrastructure development, pricing strategies, and user experience improvements. With a dataset of 1,320 EV charging sessions across multiple U.S. cities, we analyze usage across vehicle types, charger categories, time of day, and user segments. --- ## 📌 Table of Contents - [📖 Executive Summary](#-executive-summary) - [❓ Problem Statement](#-problem-statement) - [📂 Dataset Overview](#-dataset-overview) - [🧼 Data Preprocessing](#-data-preprocessing) - [📊 Exploratory Data Analysis](#-exploratory-data-analysis) - [📈 Statistical Testing](#-statistical-testing) - [💡 Key Insights](#-key-insights) - [🚀 Recommendations](#-recommendations) - [🛠️ Technologies Used](#-technologies-used) - [📁 Project Structure](#-project-structure) - [📌 Future Work](#-future-work) --- ## 📖 Executive Summary This analysis investigates EV charging behavior by user type, charger type, time, and location. Key findings include: - **DC Fast Chargers** deliver faster charging at higher costs. - **Commuters vs Long-Distance Travelers** show distinct usage patterns. - **Weekends** show longer, higher-energy charging sessions. - **Peak charging hours**: 7–9 AM and 5–8 PM. These findings can help optimize EV charging infrastructure and improve customer satisfaction. --- ## ❓ Problem Statement With EV adoption rising, charging networks face challenges in: - **Infrastructure Planning**: Where and what type of chargers are needed? - **User Segmentation**: How do behaviors vary across user types? - **Economic Optimization**: How do cost and energy use vary by location/model? - **Demand Management**: When are peak times, and how can we manage them? --- ## 📂 Dataset Overview - **Source**: Simulated dataset with 1,320 records. - **Features include**: - `Vehicle Model`, `Battery Capacity`, `User Type` - `Charging Start/End Time`, `Energy Consumed`, `Charging Rate` - `Charger Type`, `Charging Station Location` - `Charging Cost`, `Temperature`, `State of Charge`, etc. --- ## 🧼 Data Preprocessing - **Missing Values**: - Imputed with median values grouped by charger type and vehicle model. - **Outlier Treatment**: - Capped `State of Charge`, `Energy Consumed`, `Temperature`. - **Feature Engineering**: - Extracted `Start Hour` from datetime. - Created derived metrics for charging patterns. --- ## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis ### Univariate Analysis - Distribution of `Energy Consumed`, `Charging Cost`, and `User Type`. ### Bivariate Analysis - Boxplots: `Energy Consumed` vs `User Type` - Histograms: `Energy Usage` by `Day of Week` and `User Type` - Scatter Plots: `Charging Duration` vs `Energy Consumed` ### Time-Based Patterns - Peak hours: 7–9 AM and 5–8 PM. - Longer durations and higher energy usage on weekends. ### Categorical Analysis - `Charger Type` vs `Energy Consumed` - `Vehicle Model` vs `Charging Cost` - Location-based usage distribution ### Correlation Heatmap - Insights into numeric relationships between energy, cost, distance, etc. --- ## 📈 Statistical Testing - **ANOVA Tests**: - ✅ Energy use differs significantly by **Charger Type** - ✅ Charging cost varies significantly across **Vehicle Models** - ❌ No significant difference in energy consumption by **User Type** --- ## 💡 Key Insights - **DC Fast Chargers** offer speed but at a premium. - **Level 2 Chargers** are optimal for balance of speed and cost. - **Commuters** charge more frequently but use less energy. - **Long-distance travelers** consume more energy per session. - Charging activity peaks **morning and evening**. - **Older vehicles** tend to charge slower and cost more. - **Temperature** slightly impacts energy use in extreme cold. --- ## 🚀 Recommendations - Expand **DC Fast Chargers** on highways, **Level 2** in urban zones. - Implement **dynamic pricing** to reduce congestion at peak hours. - Offer **subscription plans** for frequent users. - Provide **personalized insights** based on vehicle and usage. - Partner with automakers (e.g., Tesla) for integration and marketing. - Enhance apps to show energy saved and charging suggestions. --- ## 🛠️ Technologies Used - **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) - **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** - **Statistical Testing**: SciPy (ANOVA) - **Visualization**: Seaborn, Matplotlib --- ## 📁 Project Structure ``` EV-Charging-Analysis/ ├── data/ │ └── ev_charging_patterns.csv ├── notebooks/ │ └── Electric Vehicle Charging Analysis.ipynb ├── README.md └── requirements.txt ``` --- ## 📌 Future Work - Time-series forecasting of charging demand. - Build a machine learning model to predict charging cost. - Integrate external weather and traffic data. - Dashboard for real-time charger utilization insights. --- ## 📬 Contact For questions or collaboration, please open an issue or connect via [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername). </pre>
